# Hello there, I'm Adrien - aka AlrikRr 👋

Formerly a firefighter in France 🇫🇷 🚒, I transitioned to pursue my passion for IT, particularly in offensive cybersecurity. Now, as a Pentester in Montreal 🇨🇦 for nearly three years, I've had the privilege of sharing my expertise at conferences such as NorthSec, BSides Montreal, and InCyber.

I'm open to partnerships and new opportunities, so feel free to reach out to chat about cybersecurity or anything else over a cy-beer 🍻.
